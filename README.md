# MIT_OS_LAB

This repository consists of 7 OSLab from [MIT_6.S081_2021](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/schedule.html). All labs are based on xv6, an Unix-like educational operating system built upon RISCV architecture, and each lab added some new features to the minimal os. My solution to each lab resides in corresponding branch.

### Lab Syscall
[Syscall](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/labs/syscall.html) added two syscall, `trace` and `sysinfo`, to the os. Click [here](https://github.com/dhmbb2/MIT_6.S081_OS/blob/master/report/syscall.md) for the report.
